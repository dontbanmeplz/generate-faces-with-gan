# Generate Faces with GAN in PyTorch

## Overview
One of the main problems in building a face recognition system is to collects face images as many as possible for the training dataset. Collecting images both online and offline is extremely difficult and expensive. This project address this issue by using Generative Adversarial Networks to generate new human face images. However, the GANs used here is not perfect as the generated face images are still blurred, low in resolution and sometimes unrealistic. Therefore, further improvement is required to make use of this project to solve dataset shortage problem in face recognition research.

## Quick Start
1. Clone this repository into your machine by typing the following command on your Linux terminal or Windows command prompt.
```
> git clone https://github.com/jhonsonlee/generate-faces-with-gan.git
```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook in your machine by typing the following command.
```
> jupyter notebook
```
3. On your Jupyter Notebook console head to the directory where your clone the repository and then open `dlnd_face_generation.ipynb`.

Happy coding! Happy learning!
